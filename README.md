# langcen_base

Reusable Django + Tailwind base for eLearning projects with three roles (student, teacher, admin).

## Status
Initial scaffolding. Next step: add `.gitignore` (macOS, Python/Django, npm) and project conventions.

## Why
Clone → rename → add new apps (e.g., exams, assessments) without redoing auth, layout, and tooling.

## Stack (planned)
- Django 5.2 LTS (Python 3.13)
- Tailwind via npm (CLI)
- pyenv for Python versions
